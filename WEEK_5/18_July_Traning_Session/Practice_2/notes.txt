A callable object is nything which can bae suffixed with () operator and invoked like a function

e.g : a normal function void magic ; magic();

e.g : auto fn=[](int val){std::cout<<val;}; fn();

Other examples:

Member functions of the class a functor object(a class where () operator is overloaded like we saw comparator class today)
a binded partial function created with a member function in a class



3 major parts
-------------
1) optimization of code to reduce multiple points of return in the function

2) how to make a priority queue?
    a) we need to know type of data to be fed to the queue
    b) we need to know where data will be stored i.e backend of queue
    c) we need to provide a "callable" item which can be used as a comparator
    Note : you may or may not create an alias, doesn't matter

3) unordered_set requires 3 things to be specified
    a) type of data to be stored in the fashtable i.e key
    b) a "callable" object that can be used for "hashing" (as a hash function)
    c) a "callable" object that can be used for equality check for duplicate identifier

Note 
    a) a lambda must be declared in header but initialized in cpp file (we can use extern keyword for this)
        or
    we can inline the lambda in the header file[tricky!] --> used if you code funcitionality.h using class

    b) A global function's decltype returns a function pointer, not an actual type don't use this in template parameters of unordered_set
    
    c) ordering/sequence matters in alias declaration.
