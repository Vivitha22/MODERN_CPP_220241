week agenda:

    week 2 :functional programming

supplementary concepts

    1)containers in c++
        -->vector and c-stylearray
    2) move semantics

    3)RAII Class

    4) git version control

    5) command-line utilities

    6) how to interact with large scale projects

    7) recursion and other styles of programming

What are iterators

1) cstyle array

    10         20          30







For consecutive elements

    from base-location to last element location (size-1)
        -access element as 
            base address _(location*size of each element)

For linked list

    from first location:
        - dereference to reach the element. access it 
        - now , read the address for the next element.
        - if next pointer is nullptr, break;
        - else, repeat steps

    universal algorithm

    a) for every element feched from the containers 
        (DONT GIVE A DAMN HOW YOU GET IT),
            -access the element and do something with it

iterators are abstruction over pointer to an element
