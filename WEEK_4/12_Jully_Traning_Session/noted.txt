Effective use of STL 

1)STL containers,
2)STL algorithms(more commonly used)
3)Threoetical understanding DS and algorithms


/*
    Key : Attribute or the identifer for a data item 
    e.g : employee id is key for each employee object.
    Hashing function is always applied on the key

    Hashing/Hash function :It is an mathemetical operation to determine the exact row(bucket) wher each key and its related object will be placed.

    e.g: ID mode 4

    Hash/Hash value : output of mathematical operation(hash function) applied on the key
    e.g : 0,1,2,3 are hash value

    Collision : Situation where hash function applied on 2 or more key coincide tally gives the same vlaue

    e.g: 203 mod 4 and 103 mod 4 gives answer as 3 in both the cases

    collision resolution technique:Actions that can be taken to resolve collision 
        e.g: linear probing, double hasing, open chaning, etc.
